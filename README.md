# Recursion

This repository contains 2 javascript files.

## Fibonacci

The fibonacci.js file contains 2 functions that take a number and return an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. The fibs() function solves the problem using a for loop and the fibsRec() solves it recursively.

## Merge Sort

The merge-sort.js file contains 2 functions that take in an array and return a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. They are both using recursion but they are written in a different way.
